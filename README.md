- Eliminated white spaces in data entries for consistency.  
- Converted data types to appropriate formats for accurate analysis.  
- Identified and handled null values by filling them with suitable strategies.  
- Explored data distribution using visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and KDE plots.  
- Analyzed relationships and trends between variables using a correlation matrix and scatterplots.  
- Detected and addressed outliers to ensure data quality.
